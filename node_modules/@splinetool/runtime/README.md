# Spline Runtime

**runtime** allows you to run Spline scenes in javascript.

## Install

```bash
yarn add @splinetool/runtime
```

or

```bash
npm install @splinetool/runtime
```

## Usage

To use runtime, first you have to go to the Spline editor, click on the **Export** button, select "**Code**" and then "**Vanilla JS**".

You can copy the URL there and pass it to the `.load()` function:

```js
import { Application } from '@splinetool/runtime';

// make sure you have a canvas in the body
const canvas = document.getElementById('canvas3d');

// start the application and load the scene
const spline = new Application(canvas);
spline.load('https://prod.spline.design/6Wq1Q7YGyM-iab9i/scene.splinecode');
```

You should be able to see the scene you exported in your canvas.

**NOTE**: If you are experiencing CORS issues, you can download the .splinecode file and self-host it; this will fix any CORS issue. To download, go to Spline's code export panel and click on the download icon visible in the prod.spline textarea.

> :warning: Only **.splinecode** files should be loaded through this API. `.spline` files are meant to be used in the editor.

### Read and modify Spline objects

You can query any Spline object via `findObjectByName` or `findObjectById`.

_(You can get the ID of the object in the `Develop` pane of the right sidebar)._

```js
import { Application } from '@splinetool/runtime';

const canvas = document.getElementById('canvas3d');
const spline = new Application(canvas);
spline
	.load('https://prod.spline.design/6Wq1Q7YGyM-iab9i/scene.splinecode')
	.then(() => {
		const obj = spline.findObjectByName('Cube');
		// or
		// const obj = spline.findObjectById('7AF5EBC0-09BB-4720-B045-F478F8053AA4');

		console.log(obj); // Spline Object => { name: 'Cube', id: '7AF5EBC0-09BB-4720-B045-F478F8053AA4', position: {}, ... }

		// move the object in 3D space
		obj.position.x += 10;
	});
```

### Listen to events

You can listen to any Spline Event you set in the Events panel of the editor by attaching a listener to the Spline instance.

```js
import { Application } from '@splinetool/runtime';

const canvas = document.getElementById('canvas3d');
const spline = new Application(canvas);
spline
	.load('https://prod.spline.design/6Wq1Q7YGyM-iab9i/scene.splinecode')
	.then(() => {
		spline.addEventListener('mouseDown', (e) => {
			if (e.target.name === 'Cube') {
				console.log('I have been clicked!');
			}
		});
	});
```

You can find a list of all of the Spline Event listeners in the [API](#api) section.

### Trigger Spline events from outside

You can trigger any animation Event you set in the Events panel in the Spline Editor.

You can use the `emitEvent` function, passing the [event type](#spline-events) and the name or ID of your object.

_(You can get the ID of the object in the `Develop` pane of the right sidebar)._

```js
import { Application } from '@splinetool/runtime';

const canvas = document.getElementById('canvas3d');
const spline = new Application(canvas);
spline
	.load('https://prod.spline.design/6Wq1Q7YGyM-iab9i/scene.splinecode')
	.then(() => {
		spline.emitEvent('mouseHover', 'Cube');
	});
```

Or you can query the spline object first, and then trigger the event:

```js
import { Application } from '@splinetool/runtime';

const canvas = document.getElementById('canvas3d');
const spline = new Application(canvas);
spline
	.load('https://prod.spline.design/6Wq1Q7YGyM-iab9i/scene.splinecode')
	.then(() => {
		const obj = spline.findObjectByName('Cube');
		objectToAnimate.emitEvent('mouseHover');
	});
```

You can find a list of all of the Spline Events you can pass to the `emitEvent` function in the [Spline Events](#spline-events) section.

### Preloading your scene

You might want to start the loading of `.splinecode` file before your code is loaded. It's possible using a [HTML preload Link tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Link_types/preload). Doing so will only save a little time by ensuring the spline file loading starts before your scripts are done loading. Since internally the `.splinecode` file will be loaded through a `fetch` call, you can do it like this :

```HTML
<html>
<head>
	<!--
		add a preload link tag
		with the scene your want to preload
		at the end of your <head>
		It needs to use the fetch preload type
	-->
	<link rel="preload" href="https://prod.spline.design/6Wq1Q7YGyM-iab9i/scene.splinecode" as="fetch"
</head>
```

```js
/*
	When loading the Application, use the third
	param of the load function to make sure the browser
	will use the preloaded file and not make another request
*/
spline.load(
	'https://prod.spline.design/6Wq1Q7YGyM-iab9i/scene.splinecode',
	undefined,
	{
		credentials: 'include',
		mode: 'no-cors',
	}
);
```

### Updating scene variables

If you setup variables in your Spline scene from the editor, you can change them from code either while loading the scene, of after it's loaded.
Note that if in Spline editor you have multiple variables with the same name, only the first one will be updated, so make sure to give unique names to the variables you want to update.
Also note that the values you pass to your variables will be casted into their original type (number, boolean or string).

```js
const spline = new Application(canvas);

// Create an object describing the variables you want to update during load
const myVariables = { myName: 'John', mySize: 350 };

// And pass them as second parameter for the load function
spline.load('.../scene.splinecode', myVariables);

// Later you can update your variables again
spline.setVariables({ myName: 'Paul', mySize: 100 });

// Or change only one variable
spline.setVariable('myName', 'Ringo');
```

### Procedural Transitions

If you don't want to define your transition as actions in Spline Editor, it's possible to write and control them from this API. Note that you still need to set the object states from Spline editor, this API will only enable transitioning from one state to another, essentially exposing Spline's Transition action.

```js
import { Easing } from '@splinetool/runtime'

// ...

const sphere = spline.findObjectByName('Sphere')!;

// Simplest way to transition sphere from current state to State.
// The "to" param is the only mandatory parameter.
sphere.transition({ to: 'State' });

// Same transition with all params set with their default values
sphere.transition({
  from: undefined, // State name to start from, undefined will start from current state
  to: 'State', // State name to go to, null will go to base state
  duration: 1000, // in ms
  delay: 0, // in ms
  easing: Easing.LINEAR,
  autoplay: true
});

// Force transition from Base State
sphere.transition({ from: null, to: 'State' })

// Chaining two transitions, the second one will be playing after first one is over
sphere.transition({ to: 'State' }).transition({ to: 'State 2' });

// Save transition object for later use
const transition = sphere.transition({ to: 'State', autoPlay: false }).transition({ to: 'State 2' });
transition.play()
transition.pause()
transition.reset()
transition.seek(1000)
```

### Swapping Geometries

It's possible to replace a geometry using the `app.swapGeometry(objectName, 'path/to/new.splinegeometry)` function. You first need to generate a `.splinegeometry` file from the editor by right clicking on a mesh object and selecting `Export Geometry`. This is useful if you have optional geometries / objects in your scene that you don't want to load at first. This will help make initial `.spline` file smaller and faster to load. First parameter can either object name or object UUID. Second parameter can either be the url to a `.splinegeometry` file or a Uint8Array wrapping the content of a `.splinegeometry` file.

```js
app.load('scene.spline').then(() => {
	catButton.addEventListener('click', async () => {
		// By default second parameter is an url to a .splinegeometry file
		await app.swapGeometry('Animal', 'url/to/cat.splinegeometry');
	});

	dogButton.addEventListener('click', async () => {
		// It's also possible to load the .splinegeometry file yourself if you want to manage some kind of cache or reuse one geometry for multiple objects / file
		const res = await fetch('url/to/dog.splinegeometry');
		const buffer = await res.arrayBuffer();
		const dogGeometry = new Uint8Array(buffer);
		await app.swapGeometry('Animal', dogGeometry);
	});
});
```

### Spline Objects Methods and Properties

After retrieving a Spline Object with `app.findObjectById` or `app.findObjectByName`, there are a variety of properties and methods you can call on those.

| Name        | Type                        | Description                                                                                                                                |

| `mouseUp`    | Refers to the Spline `Mouse Up` event type    |
| `keyDown`    | Refers to the Spline `Key Down` event type    |
| `keyUp`      | Refers to the Spline `Key Up` event type      |
